# Teacher-s-Analysis-Dashboard-

**Requirement:**


Teachers are one of 3DE’s greatest assets for achieving its mission. Create a Power BI
report(s) that provides insights into the following areas using the data provided.

**1.Teacher Retention Summary **– Teachers who taught during the 2023-2024 school
year and returned to teach again in the 2024-2025 school year.

**2.Teacher Certification Summary** – Teachers who completed 3DE certification level by
attending all sessions and completing all practicums.

**3.Current Teachers **– Paginated report that shows the current teachers for 2024-2025
school year for each school on a separate page.

**Explanation - 3DE Teacher Performance & Certification Insights**

"3DE Teacher Performance & Certification Insights" provides key metrics related to teacher roles, retention rates, and certification completion across various schools and academic years.
 
**Teacher Roles Overview:**
• The left panel shows the number of teachers by their primary role, with "School - Teacher" being the largest group (269 teachers).
• The chart on the right displays the number of schools based on teacher roles, and the school year breakdown shows the majority of teachers are in the 2024-2025 school year (240 teachers).


**Teacher Retention Rates:**
• The retention rate from 2023-2024 to 2024-2025 is 85%.
• Teacher retention is further broken down by school, grade level, and content area:
• Some schools have a higher retention (e.g., FNCS - North with 25 teachers retained).
• Retention is highest in 10th and 9th grades, with Science and ELA showing higher retention by content area.


**Certification Completion:**
• The completion rate is shown as 7, with 32 certification IDs tracked.
• Charts show attendance rates, practicum completion rates, and certification status:
• 78.13% attended all sessions.
• 65.63% completed their practicum, while a small percentage are certified, and others are in progress.

 
**Paginated Report**
• I published the Power BI dashboard and dataset to the workspace.
• Connected the paginated report to the semantic model in Power BI.
• Used the Query Designer to select relevant columns.
• Designed the report in table format with appropriate filters applied to show only current teachers for the 2024-2025 school year.
• Enhanced the report with grouping, sorting, page breaks, and formatting for clarity and print readiness
